# UX Journal 1 - New Printer Experience

## Kyle Handy, 03/04/2021

For my first Journal, I decided to document an interaction with my printer. A couple days ago I bought a brand new printer and figured it would be perfect to document my experience setting it up. Printers are notorious for being hard to work with, so I thought it would be interesting to see if a newly released model would fix some prevalent issues that have been around for a while. Specifically, I will be paying attention to how **error tolerant** this printer is. The **error tolerance** of this printer refers to how resilient it is to human errors. It is worth noting that I have set up several printers for friends and family over the years, so I would consider myself an experienced user in this problem space. My goal is to determine if this printer has good **error tolerance** and to document the troubles I have setting it up.

Here is a picture of the printer I will be unboxing and setting up, it is a Epson EcoTank ET-2760:

My first impressions of the user interface and the printer in general were good. The design looks sleek and the UI is simple. Here is a picture of the printer outside the box:

Even though it's a brand new printer, I still ran into a problem setting it up. Everything worked smoothly up to the point where I had to set up the wireless printing. As a computer science student I am confident when setting up new technology like this and can usually work around any issues that arise, but this one I could not. First, the printer needed to be connected to the internet. This seems like a very basic step, however the printer kept giving me "Could not connect to network" errors. After a few minutes of messing with it, I was able to connect it to a different network I have running in my house. I am still not sure why it would not connect to the first network, but it does show that printers still have some odd errors that need to be fixed. After connecting it to the internet, you needed to link it to your computer. To do this, the printer and computer needed to be on the same network. This step also had some errors. At first the printer kept failing and quitting. After looking at the Epson website for work arounds, I updated the software on both the printer and my computer. This still did not solve the problem, so I uninstalled all the printers software and then reinstalled it. Still, the printer would not connect to my laptop. There were no other suggestions on the website, so at this point I decided to give up on wireless printing. After trying all the work arounds on the Epson website, the wireless printing still was not working, which shows that modern printers definitely still have problems. Other than this one issue, setting up the printer was a breeze and definitely easier than other models I have set up.

Overall, I would say that the **error tolerance** of this printer is better than those I have worked with in the past, but still could use some improvements. The set up and actual printing is simple and easy to do, however setting up certain features such as wireless printing is still subject to lots of errors.
