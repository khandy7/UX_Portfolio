# UX Journal 2 - Coffee Machine Experience

## Kyle Handy, 04/16/2021

For this journal, I decided to document my experience with my coffee machine. I got a new Keurig coffee machine a few months ago and have enjoyed using it so far, so I thought I would analyze an interaction with it. My goal for this interaction is to document the **learnability** and **efficiency** of this coffee machine. The model of Keurig I have is the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker.

Here is a picture of the machine to show the general design.

Here is a picture of the top view, it shows the UI and where the coffee goes. This machine allows you to make either single cups of coffee using a pod or make entire pots of coffee. The two bottom buttons are how you decide which type of coffee you would like to make.

Before turning the machine on, I emptied the water container and all coffee to see how it would handle it. Once everything was emptied, I turned the machine on and went about making a cup of coffee. Immediately, the machine let me know that it needed water in order to continue, here is a picture of what it looked like.

This is an example of how the machine has good **efficiency**. The machine could just let you try to make coffee with no water and silently fail, but instead it tells you right away (before I even put the coffee in) that it needs more water in order to work. This makes the machine more **efficient** as it saves the user time by not having to check the water level every time they want a cup of coffee, the machine will just let them know if it needs more.

Another good aspect of the **efficiency** of this machine is that it starts to warm up as soon as you turn it on. Once you press the power button, you can hear it start the heating process right away. This makes the machine even more **efficient** as it does not wait until the user presses the brew button to start heating up, it is already hot by the time the user presses brew so that it can start making the coffee right away.

Once I filled up the water container, the "Add Water" message went away and the two buttons at the bottom began to blink at opposite times. I feel that this is a good **learnability** aspect of this machine. The two buttons alternating blinking is a good sign that one of those buttons needs to be pressed in order to continue. One aspect of this that I believe could be changed to even further improve the **learnability** of this machine would be to add words to the blinking buttons. I know what they mean since I have used this machine for a few months, but if I did not know I can see how it would be confusing deciding which button to press. They have symbols of a coffee pot and Keurig pod, but there is not much to distinguish these from each other. If they had the word "Pod" under the symbol of a pod and the word "Pot" under the symbol of the pot, it would improve the overall **learnability** of this product.

After deciding which type of coffee you would like to make, the numbers of the UI begin to blink to let you know that you need to select a size for your coffee. Along with this, a single word pops up to let you know what exactly those numbers represent. If you selected the Keurig Pod type, then the word "Oz" pops up to let you know the numbers represent ounces and if you selected the Pot button, then the word "Cups" pops up to let you know the numbers represent cups of coffee. This is another example of good **learnability** with this product. Below is an example picture of what it looks like if you pressed the Keurig pod button:

After selecting which size you want, the middle "brew" button begins to blink to let you know that you need to click it to confirm your choices and begin brewing. Once clicked, the machine takes it from there and dispenses whatever options the user selected.

Overall, I feel like the **efficiency** of this product is very good. It does multiple things to make the brewing of the coffee quicker and easier for the user to accomplish. The **learnability** of this product is also done fairly well. The blinking of buttons gives a good reference as to what is needed next from the user, however a couple more words added to the UI would make it even easier to understand.
